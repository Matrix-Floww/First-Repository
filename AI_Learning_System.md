## üéØ **Current Learning Entries**

### Learning Entry #001 - 2025-10-06
**Error/Issue**: User frustrated with full code block rewrites for minor bug fixes
**Context**: Code debugging and maintenance workflow
**Root Cause**: AI tendency to regenerate entire code blocks instead of targeted fixes
**Solution**: Implement GitHub integration for precise line-by-line editing
**Rule/Principle**: Always prefer targeted, surgical code fixes over full rewrites. Read entire codebase context before making changes.
**Tags**: debugging, code-maintenance, github-integration, targeted-fixes

### Learning Entry #002 - 2025-10-06
**Error/Issue**: User prefers modular, beginner-friendly code architecture
**Context**: All programming projects and code generation
**Root Cause**: User's development philosophy emphasizes maintainability and future AI/developer collaboration
**Solution**: Structure all code with clear modularity, extensive comments, and logical separation of concerns
**Rule/Principle**: Write code that is easily understood and modified by future developers and AI assistants. Break complex functionality into testable chunks.
**Tags**: modularity, code-architecture, maintainability, documentation

### Learning Entry #003 - 2025-10-06
**Error/Issue**: User has paid subscriptions to Google Gemini AI Pro and Perplexity Pro
**Context**: Tool and service recommendations
**Root Cause**: User prefers utilizing existing paid subscriptions over free alternatives
**Solution**: Prioritize solutions that work within user's existing paid subscription ecosystem
**Rule/Principle**: Always consider user's existing paid subscriptions when recommending tools or workflows.
**Tags**: subscriptions, tool-recommendations, gemini-pro, perplexity-pro
